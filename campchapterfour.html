             <h2>The Camp Chapter Four</h2>
            <p class=indent>We woke up to a loud boom from the speakers, then a voice trying a little too hard to sound comforting said “Morning kids! Breakfast will
                 be served in 10 minutes and today's schedule will start with arts and crafts time at the big orange building”.Then the speaker tuned out with a sharp
                  ringing that sounded like one of the tornado warnings from school.
            </p>
            <p class=indent> Jazz said sleepily “So I've been left to be murdered by some psycho killer, put in a cabin to sleep in a bunk where someone disappeared
                 and now I have to do arts and crafts with pinecones?!”  I nodded yes. We slowly got up from our beds, got our camp shirts and shorts out, and I went
                  into the bathroom to change.
            </p>
            <p class=indent> After I had done my hair and gotten dressed I noticed my mascara with a diamond cap was missing. I asked Jazz “Did you see my mascara?” 

                Her annoyed voice replied “No” from the other room, while I was wondering why she was not more excited about the “orange building”.    
            </p>
            <p class=indent> As we entered the big mess hall we were greeted with many sounds including kids talking, the clambering of the dishes as they were being
                 served, and the light buzzing noise from the speakers counting down the time left for breakfast. 
            </p>
            <p class=indent> While we ate our pancakes and eggs, I worried about the girls that I was bunked with two nights ago. Jazz had looked sort of awkward on
                 the walk to breakfast in sneakers and kept searching for her phone and remembering it was not going to be there all over again. I wondered how long
                  it would take her to realize she was in camp and here no electronics were allowed.
            </p>
            <p class=indent>After we finished, we started towards the first “event”, and I saw Jenny down by the lake again. I took note but didn't want to go try to
                 talk to her right then. As it turned out, I did indeed have a date with a pinecone. I thought Jazz was going to pass out from laughing, but I wasn't
                  sure if it was because she found the humor or had lost her mind in the horror that was unfolding in front of her.
            </p>
            <p class=indent>We spent the next 45 minutes picking pine cones to glue together to make “natural windchimes”. Like the woods didn't have enough strange
                 noises in the night. The whole time I wondered if maybe this was supposed to be an attempt to cover those noises, or to give the counselors something
                  to blame.
            </p>
            <p class=indent>Either way, not an exciting start to the day. But, that was before I knew the next little treat we had in store.We were headed for the canoes
                 next!
            </p>
            <p class=indent>I had gotten some experience with the canoes last year, but I don't think Jazz had ever seen one in real life. She shaded her eyes with her
                 hand and her face went into a grimace as she looked at the so-called boats, and then back to the lake. “Uh, those are not just for emergencies? Cause I
                  think we are about to have one for real!”Jazz said as her eyes buldged in disgust and fear. 
            </p>
            <p class=indent>Jazz glanced at me sharply, and then at the canoe and started to say, “Good luck with that, and may I ask-'' but right then a snake swam by
                 and Jazz jumped shrieking and air ran still about a foot above the ground for a second in the direction of the cabin before her feet had reached the ground
                  again.
            </p>
            <p clas=indent> Her screams echoed through the woods for several minutes after the cabin door slammed behind her. Jenny just sort of looked at me for a minute
                 and said, “I think Jazz might need a little more time to settle in huh?”
