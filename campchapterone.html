             <h2>The Camp Chapter One</h2>
            <p class=indent>The crisp air of the forest rushed in through my car window.I knew we were approaching the camp. Last year a series of tragedies
            had happened including missing campers and "bear attacks" during the night.The camp had just re-opened, but a feeling of dread had settled in.</p>           
            
            <p class=indent>My mom glanced in the rearview mirror and said,"Mira look, I know what happened last year, but look on the bright side. Now they have defense against the bears, and
            a limit on how long you can be out at night." I just shrugged. I mean come on I...I...just wow. I mean if my mom had been there, she would be in the boat right next to me. Then I saw, we were
            here.<br></p>
            <p class=indent>A friendly looking lady in about her 40's walked up to the car window and said,"Hi there, and what cabin are ya in?" I grunted,"Wolf Cabin" while thinking last year
            she was one of the parents, and now she is serving the same place where her daughter had died, with no respect at all. The next thing I know she handed me a note that said, "Help Us Please!"
            She winked at me and walked away. The next thing I knew my mom was pushing me out and then my bags,"By honey!" flew out the window as she sped away.</p>
            <p class=indent>I quickly found my cabin as it had a red door. It gave me goosebumps and NOT in a good way.  I remembered that Wolf Cabin was the first to get "bear attacked". I opened the door to find three girls. 1 looked older (probably the counselor).
            The other two looked about my age. I soon learned their names and interests. </p>
            <p class=indent> Too soon it was nightfall. I heard knocking at the cabin door. I felt happy knowing the door was locked and barricaded, so were the windows. Soon I heard scratching on the windows. The one mistake I made was not pulling down the blinds. I saw the killer.
            In the movies, they have some sort of mask. He did not, but his eyes were like staring at death. I must have blacked out.</p>
            <p class=indent> I woke up in the morning only to get out of bed to find my new friends missing. The window was open. I knew something was astray and I went outside of the cabin screaming at the top of my lungs, "They are missing!"
            Soon a man emerged from a cabin probably thinking, "What the heck is that girl yelling about?!" He assured me that they were just playing a prank on me, but I knew that they weren't. I walked back to my empy cabin to see a note taped to the open window. The note said
            ,"Help us please. We will help you, but you must help us." I grabbed a pen and wrote, "When do we start?" and then I walked away.</p>
