             <h2>The Camp Chapter Three</h2>
            <p class=indent> I noticed only my stuff was left in the cabin. The few things the others had taken out of their bags and found places for, were gone. 
                The cabin was even creepier alone. The dark would make it even worse. So I had decided to sleep under the bed tonight. It didn't take me long to
                 figure out if I would be locking the door and windows. If they suddenly came back from the dead, then I supposed they could just walk right through
                 the walls, and the locks wouldn't stop them. 
                </p>           
            
            <p class=indent>About the time I had everything locked and arranged, the sounds of the other campers in the mai area had died down. Everyone must have
                headed into their cabins. The darkness was setting in, and I started to get jump scared by every creak the cabin made. I tried to remember any other time
                I had slept in the woods alone. It was so strange not to have streetlights. I remembered one time we lost power for a few days after a storm. The whole
                neighborhood was dark then, but this was new level. At least there were still streets and sidewalks and familiar things around you, even if you couldn't see
                them. There were things in these woods they called insects that were bigger than my hand. Feeling eyes and antennas watching, I rethought sleeping on the floor
                with a metal bed frame over me for things to drop from. I decided I would take my chances in the bed.
            </p>

            <p class=indent>I had just checked inside my pillowcases for bugs and gotten laid down in the bed to settle in when I heard footsteps approaching. The door handle 
                rattled and there was a thump against the door. I stopped breathing and tried ot to listen. The door handle rattled and shook, and then a series of hard quick 
                knocks began on the door. Followed by a girl's annoyed voice. She said,"First I broke a heel, walking through the woods carrying my own bag, and now the door is locked?"
            </p>
            <p class=indent>It dawned on me, I had a new cabin-mate. I started breathing again feeling really stupid and made my way over to unlock the door. When I turned on the light 
                and got the door open, the girl on the other side was leaning against the wall with one hand and picking grass out of what used to be the heel of an orange shoe with the other. 
                She had an orange streak in her hair and was dressed in orange, which I would find out later was her favorite color. I was so glad for the company, I barely noticed. I waved her in
                 grabbing her bag. I wanted to get the door closed and locked again as soon as I could.
            </p>
            <p class=indent>She seemed happy to be inside with the door locked too. Clearly, this girl was as comfortable in the woods as a horse would be on a city bus. Her eyes grew wide as she looked around the cabin.
                She eventually settled her sight on her bag that I had put on her bed. I gave her a few minutes to take it all in, but I thought that some chit-chat might cover the creeks that I did not want 
                to start hearing again. So I said, "Hey, I'm Mira, sorry about that. I uh didn't know anyone was coming."</p>
               <p class=indent>My new roomie's name is Jazz, and as it turns out this was her first camp experience. It was not by choice. She was being punished for excessive use of social media. Her parents 
                thought it might do her some good to spend some time without electronics.
