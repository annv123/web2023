             <h2>The Camp Chapter Three</h2>
            <p class=indent> I noticed only my stuff was left in the cabin. The few things the others had taken out of their bags and found places for, were gone. 
                The cabin was even creepier alone. The dark would make it even worse. So I decided to sleep under the bed tonight. It didn't take me long to
                 decide I would be locking the door and windows. If they suddenly came back from the dead, then I supposed they could just walk right in.
