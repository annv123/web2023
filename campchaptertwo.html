            <p class=indent>That night he came back to finish it. I had barricaded the locked door and also pulled down the blinds on the windows. On the other side of the door I heard him say, "Sissy I'm scared."
                Then I heard a strange bumping and rubbing on the door and he went back into the darkness.
                In the morning I found a note. He claimed to be like them, the non-living. He claimed the difference was that 
                he wanted revenge and they did not.</p>
            <p class=indent>The note continued on saying he was just a child when he died and he was at peace until this camp was built. Before the camp was built he lived here until a bear attack happened causing him to 
                die. His parents died with him. That is why he mimicked bear attacks. He targeted the people of the camp because he thought that they were the reason he was seperated from his parents in the afterlife. He 
                thought them being at the camp made it harder for him to be found and collected. He had no other reason that he was trapped between heaven, earth and hell.</p>
            <p class=indent>As it turns out his parents were there, but he beleived they were just voices in his head. He decided he would not listen to them, and would do the opposite of what they said so the craziness would go away.
                Maybe it was the lack of electronics or the the wierd way sound travelled in the woods, but I thought maybe now I could hear his parents too. Two strange voices telling me that the reason I was safe was because 
                he had a sister that looks like me. If that was true, I might be the only one that could find her and make these killings stop. The battle had just begun.</p>
