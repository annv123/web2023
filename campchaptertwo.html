             <h2>The Camp Chapter Two</h2>
            <p class=indent></p>           
            
            <p class=indent>That night, my fellow cabin campers were still missing. No one was using that term yet other than me. I had barricaded the locked door and also pulled down the blinds on the windows. 
                Late into the night I heard rustling, and I swear I heard the words, "Sissy I'm scared."
                Then I heard a strange bumping and rubbing on the door and he went back into the darkness.
                In the morning I found a note. If it was from the "killer" he claimed to be like them, the non-living. He claimed the difference was that 
                he wanted revenge and my former cabin mates did not.</p>
            <p class=indent>The note continued on saying he was just a child when he died and he was at peace until this camp was built. Before the camp was built he lived here until a bear attack happened causing him to 
                die. His parents died with him. That is why he mimicked bear attacks. He targeted the people of the camp because he thought that they were the reason he was separated from his parents in the afterlife. He 
                thought them being at the camp made it harder for him to be found and collected. He had no other reason that he was trapped between heaven, earth and hell.</p>
            <p class=indent>As it turns out his parents were there, but he believed they were just voices in his head. He decided he would not listen to them, and would do the opposite of what they said so the craziness would go away.
                Maybe it was the lack of electronics or the the weird way sound travelled in the woods, but I thought maybe now I could hear his parents too. Two strange voices telling me that the reason I was safe was because 
                he had a sister that looks like me. If that was true, I might be the only one that could find her and make these killings stop. The battle had just begun.</p>
            <p class=indent>I figured it should be easy to find his name, and then maybe hers. Without any tech though I was not sure how I could look for the news report. I decided I would try to get a hold of a phone. Who would have a phone, 
                none of the campers were allowed to have one. The left the counselors. There was only one counselor I had met yet. The lady from the car window. She had asked for my help, and now I would need hers.</p>
            <p class=indent>I started trying to find her, but she seemed to have disappeared. I walked around the entire camp looking around all the cabins. I even went to the kitchen and dining areas. Finally, as I was beginning to wonder if maybe 
                I had indeed made her up like these sudden voices I could hear, I saw her checking the canoes down by the lake. She was counting them and making sure they were all tied securely when I approached. 
            </p>
            <p class=indent>I was so excited and scared at the same time. I muttered hi still not knowing if she was the shy type. She looked up from the canoes and immediately her eyes widened and I felt like a fish in an aquarium. Finally, she 
                said,"Took you long enough". I told her I needed to use her phone and she said she could use some company fixing the fishing deck and that I could use her phone to do my research. I nodded yes and we set out driving to the nearest home 
            improvement store for wood. On the ride I searched the internet for news stories about the bear attack t the camp. You would think it would be pretty easy to find since there were human deaths. If it was out there I sure couldn't find it.</p>
            <p class=indent> We chatted on the drive and I told her the information I had found out and that she wasn't the only one leaving me notes. I showed her the note I had gotten. I had debated calling the police but tell them what? I got a note I think
            from a killer? There had been no deaths. The official word from last year was run away, possibly missing teenagers. Not exactly high priority around here.</p>
            <p class=indent>The counselor, Jenny, as it turned out; knew nothing about it either. So she was no help with the name or any information or background. So I decided to just keep my eyes open for someone that looked like me, till I could find anything else out.
                Should be easy enough I thought to myself as I settled into the seat and watched the tall trees go by on either side.
            </p>
            <p class=indent>When we finally finished replacing planks and leveling dirt it was late afternoon. We had to stop for the groups and dinner. Of course there had to be s'mores cooked over a fire even if the sun was still in the sky because it was still
                camp. I had already been sacrificed to mosquitoes so I walked right into my cabin. I grabbed some pillows and threw them under the bed.</p>
