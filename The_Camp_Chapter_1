                    <p>Chapter 1
                        The crisp air of the forest rushed in through my car window. I knew we were approaching the
                        camp, last year a series of tragedies had happened including missing campers and bear attacks
                        during the night. The camp has just reopened, but a feeling of dread is setting in the whole
                        camp. My mom glanced at the rear view mirror, and said “ Mira look I know what happened last
                        year, but look at the bright side now they have defense against the bears, also a limit for how
                        long you can stay outside at night time!” I just shrugged. Thinking, I mean come on I… I ….
                        Just WOW I mean mom if you had been there you would be right in the same boat as me. We
                        were here, it was only as if I could still hear the parents crying. A friendly lady in possibly her 40s.
                        Walked to the car window and said “Hi there young lady! What cabin are ya in?” I grunted and
                        said “ Wolf cabin.” Thinking: Last year that was one of the parents, and now she is serving the
                        same place where her daughter had died, with no respect at all. The next thing I know she
                        handed me a note saying “HELP US PLEASE!!” She winked at me and walked away. Next thing
                        I know my mom was pushing me out and then my bags, “BYE HONEY” flew out the window as
                        she sped away.</p>
